![Portfolio Screenshot](/public/Screenshot.png)

My personal portfolio website created using React js, UnoCSS, Three.js, React Three Fiber, and a collection of other technologies. This website showcases my skills, education, and allows users to contact me.

## Features

-   **About Me**: A brief introduction about myself.
-   **Education**: My education.
-   **Skills**: Listed my skills and expertise.
-   **Contact**: Provided a contact form for users to get in touch with me.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
